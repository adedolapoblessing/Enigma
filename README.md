## Future Enhancements and Updates  

### Extracting Inline Styles  
To ensure better maintainability and readability of the codebase, the inline styles currently present in the HTML files should be **extracted into a dedicated CSS file**. This approach will:  
- Streamline the HTML structure, making it cleaner and easier to read.  
- Allow for centralized styling changes, enabling efficient updates and consistent design across the application.  
- Enhance scalability for future feature additions or design modifications.  

### Leveraging Advanced AI and ML Techniques  
To further enhance functionality, **complex Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** models, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, can be integrated to:  
1. **Infer Correctness:** Analyze the string of text provided by users and infer its correctness.  
2. **Improve User Experience:** Provide dynamic feedback, suggestions, or corrections based on user input.  
3. **Enhance Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks and enable intelligent decision-making within the system.

## Benefits of These Enhancements  
By implementing these updates, the project will benefit from:  
- **Improved Code Quality:** Clean separation of concerns between HTML and CSS.  
- **Advanced Functionality:** Enhanced capabilities through the integration of state-of-the-art AI technologies.  
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Simplified future updates and upgrades for the application.

## Contribution Guidelines  
Contributors are encouraged to follow the below best practices:  
- Use **semantic HTML** and adhere to coding standards.  
- Extract all styling elements into a CSS file before submitting pull requests.  
- Ensure all AI/ML model implementations are well-documented and explain the logic used for inferencing.
